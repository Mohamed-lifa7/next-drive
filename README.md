## Getting Started

To start working with Next Drive locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
- A Firebase project set up with the required API keys. Refer to the `.env.example` file for specific details on the required keys.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohamed-lifa7/next-drive.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd next-drive
```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm:

```b ash
npm install
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and populate it with the necessary API keys and configuration information from the `.env.example` file.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your API keys and configuration details.

5. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

6. The Next Drive application should now be running locally at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can access it in your web browser.

Now you have Next Drive set up locally on your machine and can start exploring and contributing to the project. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out to us.

## Configuration

The configuration settings for Next Drive are stored in the `.env.example` file in the project's root directory. To configure the application, follow these steps:

1. Locate the `.env.example` file in the project's root directory.

2. Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.

3. Open the newly created `.env` file in a text editor.

4. Modify the configuration settings as needed, including API keys and environment-specific variables. Ensure that you provide the required API keys and credentials, as specified in the `.env.example` file.

5. Save the `.env` file with your changes.

The configuration settings in the `.env` file are used by Next Drive to connect to external services, manage environment variables, and customize the behavior of the application.

**Note:** Ensure that you keep sensitive information, such as API keys and credentials, confidential and do not share them publicly. Use environment variables and consider using a secrets management solution for added security.

## Deployment

To deploy Next Drive, we recommend using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), a powerful platform for serverless deployment and hosting. Vercel is well-suited for Next.js applications and offers a seamless deployment process.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/solutions/nextjs?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=home)

**Note:** While we recommend Vercel for its ease of use and seamless integration with Next.js, you can use other platforms like Netlify or Docker if you prefer. However, for the purpose of this guide, we'll stick with Vercel as our recommended deployment platform.

Follow these steps to deploy Next Drive on Vercel:

1. Visit the [Vercel Next.js deployment guide](https://vercel.com/solutions/nextjs?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=home) to get started.

2. Sign up for a Vercel account if you don't already have one.

3. Connect your Vercel account to your GitHub repository where Next Drive is hosted.

4. Configure your deployment settings as needed.

5. Click the "Deploy" button.

> During the setup, you need to define the all the environment variables

Vercel will automatically build and deploy your Next Drive application. Once the deployment is complete, you'll receive a URL where you can access your live application.

By deploying on Vercel, you can take advantage of its powerful features, such as automatic deployments on every push to your repository, SSL certificates, and easy scaling. It's an excellent choice for hosting `Next.js` applications.
